contribution: "Sole contributor. This project leverages the C# implementation of LSL and some wrapper functions for Godot .NET to add LSL data recording to Godot. Note: this project does not contain support for markers. I am currently working on full LSL support for Godot -- email me if this interests you as it will speed me up."
