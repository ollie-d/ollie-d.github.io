contribution: "Sole contributor. An extended cognition task written in Godot 3, designed to be deployed to the web. This was my first serious project in Godot, and was designed for a Ph.D. course project. I was able to collect and analyze data from over 30 subjects from this task, and it solidified Godot as my tool of choice for creating complex experiments."
