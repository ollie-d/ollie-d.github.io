contribution: "Sole contributor. This repository contains a few Jupyter Notebooks that have multi-language cells using Script of Script (SoS). The goal was to allow for native MATLAB calls of EEGLAB functions in Python so that subsequent machine learning pipelines in Python could be used in a single notebook. Note: I would not recommend this approach."
