title: "BCI Buddy"
excerpt: "A UCSD The Basement incubator startup created by my research assistant Cassia Rizq, Gavin Roberts, and myself. Our goal was to create the neuroengineers of tomorrow via interactive projects. Users could collect their own neural data, and program their own custom brain-computer interfaces with a simple drag-and-drop Scratch-like interface. We won 3rd in a pitch competition, and succesfully piloted our product with dozens of children, and had many pre-order requests. Our company was put on pause when various members of our team had to move from San Diego."

contribution: "I was the Chief Science Officer and co-founder of BCI Buddy. Like all startup companies, I wore many hats, and worked on so much: assisting our CTO in architecting the Scratch programming interface, assisting our lead designer in creating our modular armbands and custom circuit board for acquiring biosignals, and assisting our CEO in formulating a business plan and pitching our product. My main focus was on creating and testing data acquisition and classification pipelines, including writing custom digital signal processing and machine learning classifiers for use on low-end hardware like Chromebooks."
