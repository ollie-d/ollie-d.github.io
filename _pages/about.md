I'm a cognitive neuroscientist that uses electroencephalography (EEG) to study complex human cognition during video game playing. I also work on low-cost EEG equipment and brain-computer interfaces. Since my work utilizes games to study cognition during gameplay, I also develop games -- not just for work, for fun too!

<!--
I seriously study game design and development in a manner identical to how I study cognitive neuroscience; I read papers and books, attend conferences, listen to talks, make games, and teach game development to research assistants.

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I am primarily advised by professor Virginia de Sa, and secondarily advised by professors Seana Coulson and Marta Kutas. I previously obtained my B.S. in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Machine Learning at UCSD. My academic interests are in acquiring large-scale human EEG data. One branch of this program focuses on the validation and creation of robust, low-cost EEG hardware. The other branch focuses on studying video games as a naturalistic task. Games are a natural target for nonlab data collection as they contain easily time synchronizable events, require rich cognitive engagement, and are played by hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Beyond research, I mentor students and teach courses on computational cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces.
