title: "Development and Characterization of Zinc Dry Electrodes for Wearable Electrophysiology"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: 
excerpt: 'I often have undergraduate students fabricate EEG/EMG electrodes out of sanded pennies, which are mostly zinc. A few of these students were curious to quantify how good zinc was as an electrode. Preliminary results indicate that zinc might perform as well as some silver chloride electrodes.'
