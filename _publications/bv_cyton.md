title: "Comparing Simultaneous Scalp EEG Recordings from the OpenBCI Cyton and Brain Products BrainAmp"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'We simultaneously recorded data from 8 EEG channels to the low-cost ($1,250) OpenBCI Cyton, and high-cost (>$30,000) Brain Products BrainAmp. Participants completed three standard ERP paradigms. Our signal comparisons show that the Cyton is able to record data with the same fidelity as the BrainAmp, and may even have lower variance.'
