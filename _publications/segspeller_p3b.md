title: "Set Size Effects on the P3b in a BCI Speller"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: 
excerpt: 'While analyzing data from a BCI speller, I noticed that my classifier did not perform equally well for different target letter complexities. After verifying the classifier was fine, I began looking at the neural data, and found that the complexity (set size) of the target letter produces monotonically decreasing P3b amplitude proportional to set size.'
